            <p>
                    Robert Downey, Jr. (born April 4, 1965, New York, New York, U.S.) is one of Hollywood’s most gifted and versatile actors. He earned acclaim for such early films as Chaplin (1992) and later found considerable fame as the superhero Iron Man in the Marvel film franchise. 
                In 2024 Downey won the Academy Award for best supporting actor for his performance in Oppenheimer (2023).

            <h2 id="films">Early life and first films</h2>
            <p>
                    Downey was raised in an artistic household in New York City’s Greenwich Village; his father was a noted underground filmmaker who gave the five-year-old Downey his first part. 
                After dropping out of high school in California, Downey returned to New York City to pursue an acting career. 
                Supporting roles in several movies, including the cult hit Weird Science (1985), led to a stint (1985–86) on the television comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live. 
                With his boyish looks and raffish charm, Downey then scored the lead in the romantic comedy The Pick-up Artist (1987) and broke out further with his visceral performance as a cocaine addict in Less Than Zero (1987).

            <h2 id="comeback">Chaplin, drug addiction, and comeback</h2>
            <p>
                    Steady work followed, but much of it went unnoticed until Downey’s appearance in 1992 as the title character in Richard Attenborough’s Chaplin biopic, which earned him numerous plaudits and an Academy Award nomination for best actor. 
                By this time, however, Downey had developed a substance-abuse problem, and, despite impressive turns in films ranging from the violent media satire Natural Born Killers (1994) to the costume drama Restoration (1995), 
                his frequent skirmishes with the law and his public struggle with drug addiction often overshadowed his on-screen successes. 
                He reached a low point in 1999, when he was sentenced to three years in prison for having violated parole from an earlier arrest.
                In 2000, after being granted an early release, Downey was cast in a recurring role on the television series Ally McBeal, and he won a Golden Globe Award for his work on the show. His drug problems continued, however, and he was arrested several times. 
                In 2003 Downey seemed to turn his life and career around, and he thrust himself into his work, appearing in 13 feature films over the next five years, including The Singing Detective (2003), Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and Zodiac (2007).
